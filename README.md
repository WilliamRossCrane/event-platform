# 🎉 Events Platform

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)  
This project is under active development. A few optimizations and refinements are still being made before the final version.

This project is a **Dev Events Platform** built during the [JavaScript Mastery](https://jsmastery.pro/) Next.js 16 Crash Course. It demonstrates how to create a **modern**, **scalable**, and **fully functional** event management platform with CRUD capabilities, image uploads, analytics, and cutting-edge caching.

Designed and taught by **Adrian Hajdin** of JavaScript Mastery, this build showcases how to leverage **Next.js 16**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, and **Cloudinary** to build a high-performance, real-world web app.
